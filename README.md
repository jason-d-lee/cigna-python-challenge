# **Approach**

1. Import pandas and numpy so that I can parse and transform the data into more consumable objects

2. Loop over the columns of the data - excluding the first data / time column - so that we can print out the min, max, and mean values of each column (hostname).

3. Flatten the data into a 1 dimensional array, and remove any NaN's so that we can correctly print the min, max, and mean of the entire table.
